# Presentation

A technical test in the frontend fusion selection process that aims to obtain a volunteer position, with the challenge being to develop a presentation about myself.

## üî® Project features

This challenge was created to assess developing React skills and the ability to create a personal presentation page. Here are the adapted features:

- Your name
- A brief description about you
- Your skills
- Your recent projects
- Links to your social networks (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

To stand out, we recommend implementing the following differentiators:

- Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind CSS to style your page.
- State Managers: Use state managers such as Redux or Context API to manage the application state.
- Responsiveness: Make sure your page is fully responsive and works well on different devices.
- Good Code Practices: Follow good code practices, such as file organization, reusable components and proper use of - hooks.
- Accessibility: Implement good accessibility practices to ensure that your page can be used by everyone.
- Animations and Transitions: Add animations and transitions to improve user experience.
- Semantic Commits: Use semantic commits to maintain a clear and organized commit history.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

Check out this list of everything we will use in this app:

- `Vite`
- `TypeScript`
- `TailwindCSS`
- `React Audio Player`
- `React Icons`
- `Vercel Deployment`
- `GitHub`

## üõ†Ô∏è Open and run the project

To open and run the project, run `npm i` to install the dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the project.

Then go to <a href="http://localhost:5173/">http://localhost:5173/</a> in your browser.

## üìö More tutorial information

A curious part of the development stage was that the audio file was generated in [google notebooklm](https://notebooklm.google/), it is a personalized AI research assistant, developed with the most advanced model of Google, Gemini 1.5 Pro. In the services offered by NotebookLM, you can upload your resume and ask the AI ‚Äã‚Äãto generate an audio file, creating this discussion/podcast format. I thought it was sensational, and it works for any file or subject of interest. For design inspiration, I found and adapted from [figma](https://www.figma.com/design/4W0YDUCUlYutYHjagjHCe7/Portfolio-Frontend-Minimal-(Community)?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=AvTyiEplOSUmG5SA -0) the art of Marcos Oliveira.
