# Registration FFF

A technical test in the frontend merger selection process that aims to achieve a voluntary load, the challenge being to develop a registration form for new FF members.

## 🔨 Project features

The challenge consists of developing a member registration form for the Frontend Fusion project, using React, data validation with Yup or Zod, and saving the data locally using sessionStorage or localStorage. For user feedback, a toast with an informative message was implemented.  The input data is presented below:

- Full name (required) 🗣️
- Email (required, with format validation) 📧
- Telephone (required) 📞
- Desired position (mandatory, selection from a pre-defined list):
    Frontend Developer
    Backend Developer
    Full Stack Developer
    Mobile Developer
    Software Developer
    Software Engineer
    Software Architect
    UI/UX Designer
    Systems Analyst
    Programmer Analyst
    DevOps Engineer
    Data Engineer
    QA Engineer
    Scrum Master
    Product Owner
    LinkedIn (optional) 🌐
    GitHub (optional) 🐙

## ⚙️ Techniques and technologies used

Check out this list of everything we will use in this app:

- `Vite`
- `TypeScript`
- `TailwindCSS`
- `Shadcn`
- `Zod`
- `React-hook-form`
- `Hero Icons`
- `GitHub`

## 🛠️ Open and run the project

To open and run the project, run `npm i` to install the dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the project.

Then go to <a href="http://localhost:5173/">http://localhost:5173/</a> in your browser.

## 📚 More tutorial information

Forms are the bread and butter (Brazilian expression) of the frontend developer. So why not try a different style library to spice up your toolbox? I had already heard good things about [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and I really felt the power of the tool. Extremely easy to use, and I feel like it scales well. To validate the form, I used Zod. I hadn't tested it yet, but, using [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/get-started/), I normally wouldn't use another external library, as I believe it can handle the I work alone. However, depending on the project requirements, I used it. [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) had already tested it previously. For notification, I usually use [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/), but I have to admit that shadcn's toast is really cool! So this project served to really experiment with me in different areas...
